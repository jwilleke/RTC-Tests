# TRC-Tests

The concept is to test code for the RTC module.

In this case we used the RTC Module built into the UNO WiFi R4 and used a NTP server to set the time.

More to come...

> Note We did sample code for the [Gravity I2C SD2405 RTC Module](https://github.com/jwilleke/Gravity-I2C-SD2405-RTC-Module) also.
